## 5 Ways to Try MasterClass for Free

### 1. Leverage the 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee

MasterClass‚Äôs refund policy is the closest thing to a free trial, and it‚Äôs better than most. Here‚Äôs how it works:

**Sign Up:** Choose any MasterClass plan (more on plans later).
**Explore Freely:** Get instant access to the entire library for 30 days.
**Cancel if Needed:** Not impressed? Request a full refund within 30 days, no questions asked.

#### **Why It‚Äôs Great:**

- Full access to all 200+ courses, workbooks, and offline downloads.

*Pro Tip: Set a calendar reminder for Day 28 to decide whether to keep or cancel. You could binge multiple courses in a month and walk away without spending a dime.*

### 2. Score Free Access Through Referrals and Gifting

MasterClass occasionally runs referral or gifting promotions that can unlock free access. Here‚Äôs how:

**Buy One, Gift One:** Around holidays (Black Friday, Christmas, etc.), MasterClass often offers deals where you can buy a membership and receive one free as a gift. Split the cost with a friend, and it‚Äôs like getting your subscription for half the price‚Äîor even free if they cover it!
**Referral Links:** Share your unique referral link with friends and family. If they sign up, you might earn free months or even a year of access.

**How to Find These Deals:**

Check MasterClass‚Äôs website or email newsletters during major sales.
Follow MasterClass on social media (like X) for flash promotions.

### 3. Watch Free Previews on YouTube and MasterClass.com

**YouTube Channel:** Find lesson snippets, like Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs knife skills or Chris Voss‚Äôs negotiation tips.
**MasterClass Website:** Many courses include free preview videos under the ‚ÄúSample Lessons‚Äù tab.
While these won‚Äôt give you the full course, they‚Äôre a fantastic way to gauge the teaching style and production quality.

**Examples to Check Out:**

- Neil Gaiman on world-building
- Dominique Crenn on plating techniques
- Anna Wintour on creativity in fashion

### 4. Unlock Free Trials via Partnerships

MasterClass partners with companies, universities, and credit card providers to offer free or discounted access. Here‚Äôs where to look:

**Credit Card Perks:** American Express, Capital One, or Chase sometimes include MasterClass trials as part of their rewards programs.
**Employer Benefits:** Corporate wellness or learning programs may provide free memberships.
**Student Discounts:** Platforms like UNiDAYS or university portals occasionally offer MasterClass deals.
**Library Access:** Some public libraries partner with MasterClass for free community access‚Äîcheck with your local branch.
**Action Step:** Log into your credit card or employee benefits portal and search for ‚ÄúMasterClass.‚Äù You might already have access waiting!

### 5. Take Advantage of Bundle Promotions

MasterClass frequently rolls out bundles that stretch your dollar, effectively giving you ‚Äúfree‚Äù months or memberships. Examples include:

**Duo Deals:** Buy one annual membership, and share access with a friend or family member for free.
**Extended Plans:** Get 2‚Äì3 extra months free when you sign up for an annual plan during promotions.
**Group Discounts** Some organizations or teams can access MasterClass at a reduced rate.
These deals lower the cost per user, making it feel like you‚Äôre getting premium learning for next to nothing.
