## How to Use Udemy Coupon Codes 🛒

Applying Udemy coupon codes is straightforward. Follow these steps to save on your next course:

1. **Browse Courses:** Visit Udemy’s website and search for a course (e.g., “Python programming”). Use filters for ratings or price.  
2. **Add to Cart:** Click the course thumbnail, then select “Add to Cart” or “Buy Now.”  
3. **Proceed to Checkout:** Go to your cart (top-right corner). Below the subtotal, find the “Enter Coupon” field.  
4. **Apply the Code:** Paste your coupon code (e.g., “LETSLEARNNOW” for 97% off) and click “Apply.” The discount reflects instantly.  
5. **Complete Purchase:** Log in or create an account, enter payment details (credit card, PayPal), and finalize the order.
