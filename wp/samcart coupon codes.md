## Detailed Features of SamCart and Their Benefits 🛠️✨

![Samcart Features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digiexe-official/dg/refs/heads/main/imgs/samcart/samcart%20features.png)

### 1. One-Click Upsells 🔄  
**Feature:** After a customer completes their purchase, SamCart lets you offer additional products or upgrades with just one click—no need to re-enter payment details.  
**Benefit:** This smooth, hassle-free upsell process significantly increases your average order value and overall revenue. Customers are more likely to add extra items when the process is quick and seamless, improving your sales without extra advertising costs.

### 2. Order Bumps 🛒  
**Feature:** Order bumps are complementary offers presented directly on the checkout page as optional add-ons. For example, if someone buys an online course, you can offer a relevant eBook or toolkit at a discounted price.  
**Benefit:** Since order bumps are offered right at the point of purchase, they tap into a customer’s buying mindset, boosting sales effortlessly. This increases your revenue per transaction without creating friction or adding steps to the checkout.

### 3. Subscription Saver 💳  
**Feature:** SamCart automatically retries failed subscription payments and sends reminder emails to customers whose payments didn’t go through.  
**Benefit:** Recurring revenue is vital for business growth, but failed payments can cause churn. Subscription Saver helps you reduce involuntary cancellations and recover lost income by keeping more subscribers active, improving your monthly recurring revenue.

### 4. Drag-and-Drop Checkout Builder 🎨  
**Feature:** Customize your checkout pages easily using a drag-and-drop interface without needing any coding skills. You can add images, testimonials, buttons, custom fields, and more.

### 9. Cart Abandonment Recovery ⏳  
**Feature:** Automatically send emails to visitors who add products to their cart but don’t complete the purchase, encouraging them to return and finish checkout.  
**Benefit:** Cart abandonment is a major cause of lost sales. Recovery emails bring customers back with gentle reminders and can include incentives, recovering revenue that would otherwise be lost.
